# Push-forward, pooling and unpooling

This section shows how the push-forward operation of Definition \@ref(def:pushing-exact-definition) can be used to realize (un)pooling operations on CCs, and subsequently introduces (un)pooling operations for CCNNs. Further, this section demonstrates how CC-based pooling provides a unifying framework for image and graph-based pooling, and how shape-preserving pooling on CCs is related to the mapper on graphs.

In particular, we establish yet another unifying mathematical principle: pooling, as message passing, can be fundamentally built from push-forward operations. Thus, push-forward operations form the main fundamental building block from which all higher-order computations can be realized. This realization is important because it establishes a mathematical foundation for a unifying deep learning application programming interface (API) on complexes that combines pooling as well as message passing-based computations as a single operation. Indeed, in [TopoModelX](https://github.com/pyt-team/TopoModelX), one of our contributed Python packages, higher-order message passing and the pooling/unpooling operations are implemented as a single function across various topological domains.

## CC-pooling and unpooling

We define a CC-based pooling operation that extends the main characteristics of image-based and graph-based pooling operations. Specifically, we build a pooling operation that `downscales' the size of a signal supported on a CC $\mbox{X}$. To this end, we exploit the hierarchical nature of CCs and define the pooling operation as a push-forward operation induced by a cochain map $G\colon\mathcal{C}^{i}(\mathcal{X})\to \mathcal{C}^{j}(\mathcal{X})$ that pushes an $i$-cochain to a $j$-cochain. To obtain a useful pooling operation that downscales the size of its input $i$-cochain, we impose the constraint $j>i$. Definition \@ref(def:pooling-exact-definition) realizes our idea of CC-pooling. Figure \@ref(fig:pooling-hoans) visualizes the intuition behind Definition \@ref(def:pooling-exact-definition). In particular, Figure \@ref(fig:pooling-hoans) shows an example of successive applications of pooling operations on cochains supported on a CC of dimension three.

```{definition, pooling-exact-definition, name="CC-pooling operation"}
Let $\mbox{X}$ be a CC and $G\colon\mathcal{C}^{i}( \mbox{X})\to \mathcal{C}^{j}( \mbox{X})$ a cochain map. The push-forward operation induced by $G$ is called a *CC-pooling operation* if $j>i$.
```

```{r pooling-hoans, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="An example of successive CC-(un)pooling operations. A CC-pooling operation exploits the hierarchical structure of the underlying CC to coarsen a lower-rank cochain by pushing it forward to higher-order cells. CC-pooling operations improve invariance to certain distortions. Pink, blue, and green cells have ranks one, two, and three, respectively. A CC $\\mbox{X}$ of dimension three is shown in (a). On $\\mbox{X}$, we consider three cochain operators: $B_{0,1} \\colon\\mathcal{C}^1\\to \\mathcal{C}^0$, $B_{1,2} \\colon\\mathcal{C}^2\\to \\mathcal{C}^1$ and $B_{2,3}\\colon\\mathcal{C}^3\\to \\mathcal{C}^2$. For the top row in Figures (b), (c), and (d), we assume that we are initially given a 0-cochain $\\mathbf{H}_0$, while for the bottom row in the same figure, we assume that we are initially given a 3-cochain $\\mathbf{H}_3$. For instance, at the top row of Figure (b), the input 0-cochain $\\mathbf{H}_0$ gets pushed forward via the functional $\\mathcal{F}_{B_{0,1}^T} \\colon\\mathcal{C}^0\\to \\mathcal{C}^1$  to a 1-cochain $\\mathbf{H}_1$. This push-forward operator induced by $B_{0,1}^T$ is a CC-pooling operator, since it sends a 0-cochain to a cochain of higher rank. At the bottom row of Figure (b), the push-forward operator $\\mathcal{F}_{B_{0,1}}\\colon \\mathcal{C}^1\\to \\mathcal{C}^0$ induced by $B_{0,1}$ is an unpooling operator that sends a $1$-cochain to a $0$-cochain. Figures (c) and (d) are similar to (b), demonstrating the pooling operators induced by $B_{1,2}^T$ and $B_{2,3}^T$ (top), and the unpooling operators induced by $B_{1,2}$ and $B_{2,3}$ (bottom)."}

In Definition \@ref(def:unpooling-exact-definition), we introduce an unpooling operation on CCs that pushes forward a cochain to a lower-rank cochain. Figure \@ref(fig:pooling-hoans) shows as example of unpooling on CCs.

```{definition, unpooling-exact-definition, name="CC-unpooling operation"}
Let $\mbox{X}$ be a CC and $G\colon\mathcal{C}^i( \mbox{X})\to \mathcal{C}^j( \mbox{X})$ a cochain map. The push-forward operation induced by $G$ is called a *CC-unpooling operation* if $j<i$.
```

## Formulating common pooling operations as CC-pooling

In this section, we formulate common pooling operations in terms of CC-pooling. In particular, we demonstrate that graph and image pooling can be cast as CC-pooling.

### Graph pooling as CC-pooling

Here, we briefly demonstrate that the CC-pooling operation (Definition \@ref(def:pooling-exact-definition)) is consistent with a graph-based pooling algorithm. Let $\mathbf{H}_0$ be a cochain defined on the vertices and edges of a graph $\mathcal{G}$. Moreover, let $\mathbf{H}^{\prime}_0$ be a cochain defined on the vertices of a coarsened version $\mathcal{G}^{\prime }$ of $\mathcal{G}$. Under such a setup, $\mathbf{H}^{\prime}_0$ represents a coarsened version of $\mathbf{H}_0$. A graph pooling function supported on the pair $(\mathcal{G},\mathbf{H}_0)$ is a function of the form $\mathcal{POOL} \colon (\mathcal{G},\mathbf{H}_0) \to (\mathcal{G}^{\prime},\mathbf{H}^{\prime}_0)$ that sends every vertex in $\mathcal{G}$ to a vertex in $\mathcal{G}^{\prime}$, which corresponds to a cluster of vertices in $\mathcal{G}$. We now elucidate how the function $\mathcal{POOL}$ can be realized in terms of CC-pooling.

```{proposition, pool, name="The role of CC-pooling"}
The function $\mathcal{POOL}$ can be realized in terms of CC-pooling operations.
```

```{proof}
Each vertex in the graph $\mathcal{G}^{\prime}$ represents a cluster of vertices in the original graph $\mathcal{G}$. Using the membership of these clusters, we construct a CC by augmenting $\mathcal{G}$ by a collection of 2-cells, so that each of these cells corresponds to a supernode of $\mathcal{G}^{\prime}$. We denote the resulting CC structure by $\mathcal{X}_{\mathcal{G}}$, consisting of $\mathcal{G}$ augmented by the 2-cells. Hence, any 0-cochain $\mathbf{H}^{\prime}_0$ defined on $\mathcal{G}^{\prime}$ can be written as a 2-cochain $\mathbf{H}_2 \in \mathcal{C}^2(\mathcal{X}_{\mathcal{G}})$. The relation between the vertices of the original graph $\mathcal{G}$ and the vertices of the pooled graph $\mathcal{G}^{\prime}$, or equivalently the CC $\mathcal{X}_{\mathcal{G}}$, is described via the incidence matrix $B_{0,2}^T$. Hence, learning the signal $\mathbf{H}_2$ can be realized in terms of a map $B_{0,2}^T \colon \mathcal{C}^{2} (\mathcal{X}_{\mathcal{G}}) \to \mathcal{C}^{0}(\mathcal{X}_{\mathcal{G}})$ that pushes forward the cochain $\mathbf{H}_0$ to  $\mathbf{H}_2$.
```

The 2-cells defined on $\mathcal{X}_{\mathcal{G}}$ can be practically constructed using the *mapper on graphs* [@hajij2018mog], a classification tool in TDA. See Section \@ref(mapper-and-the-cc-pooling-operation) for more details of such a construction.

### Image pooling as CC-pooling

Since images can be realized as lattice graphs, a signal stored on an image grid can be realized as a 0-cochain of the lattice graph that corresponds to the image. See Figures \@ref(fig:image-pooling)(a--b) for an example. Here, we demonstrate that the CC-pooling operation (Definition \@ref(def:pooling-exact-definition)) is consistent with the known image-pooling definition. Indeed, one may augment the lattice graph of Figure \@ref(fig:image-pooling)(b) by 2-cells, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:image-pooling)(c), to perform the image pooling operation. Usually, these cells have a regular window size. In Figure \@ref(fig:image-pooling)(c), we have chosen the pooling window size, or equivalently the size of the 2-cell, to be $2\times 2$, and the pooling stride to be 1. The image pooling operation in this case can be realized as a CC-pooling operation induced by the cochain map $B_{0,2}^T \colon\mathcal{C}^0 \to \mathcal{C}^2$, as visualized in Figure \@ref(fig:image-pooling)(d). We formally record this in the following proposition.

```{r image-pooling, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Realizing image pooling in terms of CC-pooling. (a): An image of size $3\\times3$. (b): The lattice graph that corresponds to the image given in (a). (c): Augmenting the lattice graph with 2-cells. Choosing these particular cells shown in (c) is equivalent to choosing the image-pooling window size to be $2\\times 2$ and the pooling stride to be one. (d): Performing the image-pooling computation is equivalent to performing a CC-pooling operation induced by the cochain map $B_{0,2}^T \\colon\\mathcal{C}^0 \\to \\mathcal{C}^2$, which pushes forward the image signal (the $0$-cochain supported on $\\mathcal{X}^2$) to a signal supported on $\\mathcal{X}^2$."}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/image_pooling.png', dpi=NA)
```

```{proposition, image-pool, name="Realization of image ppooling"}
An image pooling operator can be realized in terms of a push-forward operator from the underlying image domain to a 2-dimensional CC obtained by augmenting the image by appropriate 2-cells where image pooling computations occur.
\end{proposition}

```{proof}
The proof is a straightforward conclusion from the definition of image pooling.
```

## Pooling and unpooling CCNNs

The pooling operator of Definition \@ref(def:pooling-exact-definition) considers only the special case in which the tensor diagram of a CCNN has a single edge. In what follows, we generalize the notion of pooling by identifying the defining properties that characterize a CCNN as a pooling CCNN. To this end, we start with a CCNN whose tensor diagram has a height of one.

```{definition, height-1-pooling, name="Pooling CCNN of height one"}
Consider a CCNN represented by a tensor diagram $\mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G};\mathbf{W}}$ of height one. Let $\mathcal{C}^{i_1}\times\mathcal{C}^{i_2}\times \cdots \times  \mathcal{C}^{i_m}$ be the domain and let $\mathcal{C}^{j_1}\times\mathcal{C}^{j_2}\times \cdots \times \mathcal{C}^{j_n}$ be the codomain of the CCNN. Let $i_{min}=min(i_1,\ldots,i_m)$ and $j_{min}=min(j_1,\ldots,j_n)$. We say that the CCNN is a *pooling CCNN of height one* if

1. $i_{min}< j_{min}$, and
2. the tensor diagram $\mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G};\mathbf{W}}$ has an edge labeled by a cochain operator $G\colon \mathcal{C}^{i_{min}} \to \mathcal{C}^{k}$ for some $k\geq j_{min}$.
```

Intuitively, a CCNN represented by a tensor diagram of height one is a pooling CCNN of height one if it pushes forward its lowest-rank signals to higher-rank cells. Observe that a readout operation can be realized as a pooling CCNN of height one; see Figure \@ref(fig:readout) for an illustration.

```{r readout, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Examples of pooling operations. In this example, a CC of dimension three is displayed. A rank cell of rank $3$ (shown in green) has the highest rank among all cells in the CC. (a): A pooling CCNN of height one pools a cochain vector $(\\mathbf{H}_0,\\mathbf{H}_1)$ to a 2-cochain $\\mathbf{H}_2$. (b): A readout operation can be realized as a pooling CCNN of height one by encapsulating the entire CC by a single (green) cell of rank higher than all other cells in the CC, and by pooling (reading out) all signals of lower-order cells to the encapsulating (green) cell."}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/read_out.png', dpi=NA)
```

A CCNN may not perform a pooling operation at every layer, and it may preserve the dimensionality of the lowest-rank signal. Before we give the general definition of pooling CCNNs, we first define lowest rank-preserving CCNNs of height one.

```{definition, lowest-rank, name="Lowest rank-preserving CCNN of height one"}
Consider a CCNN represented by a tensor diagram of height one. Let $\mathcal{C}^{i_1}\times\mathcal{C}^{i_2}\times \cdots \times  \mathcal{C}^{i_m}$ be the domain and let $\mathcal{C}^{j_1}\times\mathcal{C}^{j_2}\times \cdots \times \mathcal{C}^{j_n}$ be the codomain of the CCNN. Let $i_{min}=min(i_1,\ldots,i_m)$ and $j_{min}=min(j_1,\ldots,i_n)$. We say that the CCNN is a *lowest rank-preserving CCNN of height one* if $i_{min}= j_{min}$.
```

Every CCNN is a composition of CCNNs that are represented by tensor diagrams of height one. Hence, pooling CCNNs can be characterized in terms of tensor diagrams of height one, as elaborated in Definition \@ref(def:general-pooling-hoan).

```{definition, general-pooling-hoan, name="Pooling CCNN"}
Let $\mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G};\mathbf{W}}$ be a tensor diagram representation of a CCNN. We decompose the CCNN as
\begin{equation*}
\mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G};\mathbf{W}}=
\mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G}_N;\mathbf{W}_N} \circ \cdots \circ \mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G}_1;\mathbf{W}_1},
\end{equation*}
where $\mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G}_i;\mathbf{W}_i},i=1,\ldots,N$, is a tensor diagram of height one representing the $i$-th layer of the CCNN, and $\mathbf{G}_i \subseteq \mathbf{G}$. We call the CCNN represented by $\mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G};\mathbf{W}}$
a *pooling CCNN* if

1. every $\mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G}_i;\mathbf{W}_i}$ is either a pooling CCNN of height one or a lowest rank-preserving CCNN of height one, and
2. at least one of the layers $\mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G}_i;\mathbf{W}_i}$ is a pooling CCNN of height one.
\end{enumerate}
```

Intuitively, a pooling CCNN is a CCNN whose tensor diagram forms a 'ladder' that pushes signals to higher-rank cells at every layer. Figure \@ref(fig:tensor)(d) gives an example of a pooling CCNN of height two.

An unpooling CCNN of height one is defined similarly to a pooling CCNN of height one (Definition \@ref(def:height-1-pooling)), with the only difference being that the inequality $i_{min}<j_{min}$ becomes $i_{min}>j_{min}$. Moreover, an unpooling CCNN (Definition \@ref(def:general-unpooling-hoan)) is defined analogously to a pooling CCNN (Definition \@ref(def:general-pooling-hoan)).

```{definition, general-unpooling-hoan, name="Unpooling CCNN"}
Let $\mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G};\mathbf{W}}$ be a tensor diagram representation of a CCNN. We decompose the CCNN as
\begin{equation*}
\mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G};\mathbf{W}}=
\mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G}_N;\mathbf{W}_N} \circ \cdots \circ \mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G}_1;\mathbf{W}_1},
\end{equation*}
where $\mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G}_i;\mathbf{W}_i},i=1,\ldots,N$, is a tensor diagram of height one representing the $i$-th layer of the CCNN, and $\mathbf{G}_i \subseteq \mathbf{G}$. We call the CCNN represented by $\mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G};\mathbf{W}}$ an *unpooling CCNN* if

1. every $\mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G}_i;\mathbf{W}_i}$ is either an unpooling CCNN of height one or a lowest rank-preserving CCNN of height one, and
2. at least one of the layers $\mbox{CCNN}_{\mathbf{G}_i;\mathbf{W}_i}$ is an unpooling CCNN of height one.
```
