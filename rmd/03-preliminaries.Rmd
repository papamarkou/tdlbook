# Preliminaries

The notion of proximity among entities in a set $S$ holds significant relevance in various machine learning applications as it facilitates the comprehension of inter-entity relationships in $S$. For example, clustering algorithms aim to group points that are proximal to each other. In recommendation systems, the objective is to suggest items that exhibit similarity to those for which a user has already expressed interest. However, the question is how do we precisely quantify the notion of proximity? 

Consider a set $S$ consisting of a collection of abstract entities, as depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:proximity)(a). Consider the red entity (vertex) $x$ in the same figure. We wish to identify the entities (vertices) in $S$ that are 'closely related' or 'in close proximity' to $x$. However, a set has no inherent notion of proximity or relations between its entities.

Defining binary relations (edges) among the entities of set $S$ provides one way of introducing the concept of proximity, which results in a graph whose vertex set is $S$, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:proximity)(b). Using this 'auxiliary structure' of edges defined on top of set $S$, one may declare the 'local neighborhood' of $x$, denoted by $\mathcal{N}(x)$, to be the subset of $S$ consisting of all entities that are adjacent to $x$ via an edge. In Figure \@ref(fig:proximity)(b), the neighborhood of vertex $x$ (in red) in $S$ consists of all vertices colored in yellow.

The choice of neighborhood $\mathcal{N}(x)$ in Figure \@ref(fig:proximity)(b) is arbitrary. For example, an alternative valid notion of neighborhood is given by defining $\mathcal{N}(x)$ to contain all vertices whose distance from the red vertex $x$ is at most two, represented by all vertices colored in yellow in Figure\@ref(fig:proximity)(c). In Figure \@ref(fig:proximity)(d), the neighborhood $\mathcal{N}(x)$ is chosen to consist of all yellow vertices that form triangles incident to red vertex $x$. In Figure \@ref(fig:proximity)(e), the neighborhood $\mathcal{N}(x)$ is chosen to consist of all yellow vertices that form trapezoids incident to the red vertex $x$. It becomes clear from Figures \@ref(fig:proximity)(d) and (e) that additional auxiliary structures, such as triangles and trapezoids, can be used to define the notion of neighborhood. In practice, the choice of neighborhood typically depends on the application. Recent research has explored using graph geometry to obtain richer neighborhood notions, as seen in [@morris2019weisfeiler; @hajijcell; @zhao2022from]. However, the fundamental concept remains the same: one starts by introducing an auxiliary structure defined on a vertex set, and then utilizes the auxiliary structure to induce a well-defined notion of proximity.

Upon generalizing graphs to higher-order networks, it is natural to also generalize the notion of neighborhood for graphs to higher-order networks. The precise notion of neighborhood or proximity among entities of a set $S$ has been studied in topology [@munkres1974]. A topology defined on $S$ allows us to meaningfully describe the proximity of the elements in $S$ to each other. This section introduces topological notions and definitions with the aim of generalizing graphs to higher-order networks.
